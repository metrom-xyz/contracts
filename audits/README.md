# Audits

Three audits of this codebase were performed. One by
[Hats Finance](https://hats.finance) in a crowdsourced fashion, while the others
from [0xCommit](https://www.0xcommit.com/) and [Sherlock](https://sherlock.xyz/)
with a more traditional approach. The findings for the Hats audit, along with
links to any implemented fixes, can be found
[here](https://github.com/hats-finance/Metrom-0xfdfc6d4ac5807d7460da20a3a1c0c84ef2b9c5a2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alow%2Cmedium%2Chigh).

As for the 0xCommit audit, their report can be found [here](./0xCommit.pdf), and
for Sherlock, [here](./Sherlock.pdf).
